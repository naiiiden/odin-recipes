        <h3>Mandazi is a form of fried bread that originated on the Swahili Coast.</h3>
        <p>Mandazi are similar to doughnuts, having a little bit of a sweet taste which can be differentiated with the addition of different ingredients. However; they are typically less sweet than the United States style of doughnuts and are usually served without any glazing or frosting. They are frequently made triangular in shape (similar to samosas), but are also commonly shaped as circles or ovals. When cooked, they have a "fluffy" texture.</p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting</li>
            <li>1/2 cup sugar(100g)</li>

            <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, cardamom, and salt. Make a well in the center, then use a rubber spatula to mix in the egg and coconut milk until the dough comes together.</li>
            <li>Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead until smooth. Dive the dough into 4 portions. Roll out 1 portion of dough into a circle about ¼-inch (6 ml) thick. Cut into 8 triangles. Repeat with the remaining dough portions.</li>
